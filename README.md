# Sentiment-Analysis-for-FOMC-Statements

This project automates the analysis of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statements by extracting sentiment and key rate decision information from over 500 statements spanning 20+ years. Analysts at banks and hedge funds traditionally had to eyeball through lengthy statements to gauge overall sentiment and make informed decisions. By leveraging NLTK and a Bag-of-Words approach, this project automates the process, reducing the lead time from hours to seconds.
